# sharing-bay

SharingBay is a fully functional NodeJS web application for people to share and discover experience around the world. 

The project also combined with another project [BlogModel](https://github.com/DeclanFang/blog-model). From that people can add friends and view friends' posts only, which make the application into social networking oriented.

For now what the application has achieved was creating, editing, deleting any posts and comments by user-self, and users are not allowed to change others' posts and comments. Also, people are free to view others' profile after sign in or sign up.
